            <h5>About Me</h5>
            <p>Hello! My name is Rochelle Singco Romualdo, and I am currently a 3rd-year Information Technology student at NORUS (Northern University of the Philippines). I am passionate about the ever-evolving world of technology and how it can be used to solve real-world problems. As a student in the field of IT, I am constantly honing my skills in areas such as programming, networking, and software development, with the goal of contributing to innovative solutions in the tech industry.

                I have always had an interest in problem-solving, which is one of the main reasons I chose to pursue a career in IT. In addition to my academic pursuits, I enjoy exploring new technologies, working on personal projects, and collaborating with peers on various tech-related challenges. I believe that technology has the potential to shape the future, and I am excited to be a part of this transformative field.
                
                When I'm not studying or working on projects, I enjoy [add any hobbies or interests, e.g., reading, gaming, attending tech meetups, traveling, etc.]. I also take pride in my ability to stay organized, manage time effectively, and adapt quickly to new situationsâ€”skills that I believe will be invaluable in my future career.
                
                I look forward to expanding my knowledge, building meaningful connections with like-minded individuals, and contributing positively to the technology community!</p>
